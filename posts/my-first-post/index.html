<p>Quantum, I use here to denote the smallest independent unit of a substance/construct which is further indivisible into functional units. So what I will be talking about is what is the smallest unit inside of us or even external to us that can be considered the basic unit of self. To help understand this better we can take an example from biology – cell. It is the basic unit of life or rather the quantum of life. It is to my best knowledge as of now unknown something further inside the cell which is capable of being called “alive”. I really don’t have a clear-cut answer as to what we can consider the quantum of self but let’s explore some proposed candidates, some in the realm of science and some in the supernatural. Let’s start our discussion with the question – “What is self?”
Who am I?</p>
<p>This is the question that troubles almost everyone and more-so people with anxious minds or high propensity to “think” and “rummage” over. I for one am plagued with this recently and have always been fascinated with this inquiry, both in spiritual sense and the literal sense that I wish to trace back to biology or even fundamental particles.</p>
<p>There doesn’t seem to be any definitive answer to this if I consider the scientific realm due to the gray area between the actual processes of life and how they give birth to consciousness, fundamentally we don’t understand how consciousness arises. One might be tempted to say that brain is the organ of consciousness which implies neurons as the quantum of consciousness but I am not very convinced with this as we can isolate neurons with modern advances and yet we do not associate any sort of consciousness to these isolated neurons. Sure they are living, metabolizing and even moving but probably not conscious. The conscious awareness of self, “This is me, I am, I can feel how it is to be in my body”, is a superior kind of cognitive function which is at best materialized by a network of neurons, but is that really so? If that is so, we can build artificial neural networks as complex as our own (someday in future) and it should possess the conscious awareness I was talking about?</p>
<p>Secondly taking the body as a whole, we never associate consciousness with other body parts (i.e. cells other than neurons or specifically cells outside CNS). This might be a valid assumption but one has to ask why don’t we associate ourselves with, say our skin cells? The skin cells die and shed off on a daily basis yet we never think about them much. Why not? The skin cells are a part of “me”, they have the same genetic makeup as my whole body and they are visibly defining the boundaries of “me” with the surrounding space. Why then aren’t skin cells, us? Why don’t we associate them with the idea of self? I haven’t been able to find out a convincing answer to these questions as they all end up with more questions, more profound than the previous one. Let’s talk about a thought experiment which is obviously not my original idea, it takes on a hypothetical situation in which there are two people A and B. With some sophisticated process we start to replace cells of A with cells of B one by one. At all points of this process keeping the vitals under check. Now the question here is that at which point does A become B and B becomes A, or that never happens? Maybe now they are completely different persons C and D? The latter is too vast to be discussed here, taking the former case when A becomes B and B becomes is the defining point of quantum of self. We can hypothesize that when all the quanta of self have been replaced between A and B, they take on the identity of each other. The only thing is to find this quantum of self, I will from now on refer to quantum of self as conscion.</p>
<p>The existence of conscion is just a hypothesis and it might not even exist, here you can see my inherent bias in coining that terminology consci-on which is a crude combination of consciousness and how physicists name fundamental particles (photon, gluon, boson….) I will try to explain the terminology along the flow of the article.</p>
<p>So, who am I? Am I my cells, my DNA? Am I a specific network of specific cells? Or maybe just a self-induced manifestation? According to me, I am all this and some more – conscion.
Conscion</p>
<ol>
<li>Neural Network</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s start by exploring conscion as the basic neuronal structure inside of our brains. Here I will try to restrict myself only to the cortex (Telencephalon) in order to see how the idea of self could just be a by product of more neural circuitry. The frontal portion of the brain is a recent evolutionary step and only mammals seem to have them with varying degrees of complexity across various species. The so called “intelligence” is something that might be unique to us, that is the conscious awareness of self. One of the by product of such high level of cognition is the creation of ideas, imagination, thoughts. Extending this we can say that the notion of self is just a construct of this high order cognition arising just from the complex neuronal circuitry we evolved over time. This line of thought puts the seat of consciousness in the brain and specifically some special neuronal circuitry. Thus conscion could be a neural network or a special arrangement of neuron like objects. But this also posits that we can always replicate consciousness through artificial means which I don’t feel like accepting as of now.
2. Cell</p>
<p>Cell – the basic unit of life, there is a lot of truth in that statement but we are intelligent enough to differentiate between “living” and “conscious”. I will not go into much trouble to differentiate them here but let’s keep the distinction in mind. The cell itself isn’t aware about it’s existence directly which is not very hard to observe but the cell interacts with its environment quite intelligently. Excluding the basic survival processes inside the cell we can say that a cell is intelligent enough to “know” it’s function and hierarchical order in the body of an organism. Cells know what to do, how to do it and when to not do it. Of course this stems from the internal cellular machinery but this intelligence is not so obvious at times just because of that machinery. For example, a stem cell knows when it divides to form what kind of cell, how does it do that? By interacting with its environment through chemicals, ions etc. Now this is some form of primitive intelligence and hence I propose cells as a candidate for conscion though not a very strong candidacy.
3. DNA</p>
<p>DeoxyriboNucleic Acid- DNA, the famous double helix or even the quantum of heredity is just a molecule. A combination of several atoms composed of fundamental particles. Not alive for sure, or is it? If we hold fast to the classical definitions of life we can certainly say that DNA is not alive. But if we give some thought to this, we are just a vehicle for our DNA to replicate itself! I would say it is the smartest thing to exist, it builds everything around itself to protect itself, nurture and make copies with some minor differences over generations that essentially helps it replicate more efficiently (natural selection). One would definitely call this high selfish “molecule” conscious due to the above argument and then again everything alive forms from it so it seems like a pretty basic unit of everything alive which is not itself alive. Extending the argument we can say self = my unique DNA sequence, thus a conscion.</p>
